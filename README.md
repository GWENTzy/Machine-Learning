<h1>Machine Learning</h1>

This repository aims to summarized various machine learning projects that have been worked on during lectures

In this repo, mostly I use some library such as:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

<h2>Reminder</h2>
But it doesn't mean all of the project here using build-in library, here also provide several algorithms from scratch which will help us to udnerstand about the matemathic and logic behind each of the algorithms.  

<h2>Cant Open the File? </h2>

In case you can't open the .ipynb file and get the error message, such as:

> "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

You can open it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste the link to that site.
