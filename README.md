# Machine Learning

This repository aims to summarized various machine learning projects that have been worked on during lectures

In this repo, mostly I use some library such as:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Reminder

But it doesn't mean all of the project here using build-in library, here also provide several algorithms from scratch which will help us to udnerstand about the matemathic and logic behind each of the algorithms.  

## Cant Open the File?

In case you can't open the .ipynb file and get the error message, such as:

> `"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"`

You can open it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste the link to that site.
